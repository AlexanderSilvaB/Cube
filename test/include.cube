/* 
    Every included file is loaded as a module at compiling time
    The statement 'include math' includes 'math.cube' as a module named 'math' 
    A module name can be changed using the 'as' keyword. E.g: 'include math as m'
    Modules are acessible by calling moduleName.function. E.g: 'math.sin'
    To include a module without a name and thus globally in the current context,
    use the name 'default' for the module. E.g: 'include math as default'.
