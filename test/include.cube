/* 
    Every included file is loaded as a package at compiling time
    The statement 'include math' includes 'math.cube' as a package named 'math' 
    A package name can be changed using the 'as' keyword. E.g: 'include math as m'
    Packages are acessible by calling packageName.function. E.g: 'math.sin'
    To include a package without a name and thus globally in the current context,
    use the name 'default' for the package. E.g: 'include math as default'.
