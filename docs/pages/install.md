## Installation

Currently, to install Cube it is needed to compile the source code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/AlexanderSilvaB/Cube){:target="_blank"}. 


To make things simple, it is recomended to build directly using [cmake](https://cmake.org/){:target="_blank"} or using [cmake-tools](https://github.com/AlexanderSilvaB/cmake-tools){:target="_blank"}.

After building Cube, run it directly or passing a '.cube' file as argument.
