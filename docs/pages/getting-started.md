## Getting started

Cube is a dynamic typed, object oriented, programming language. The language is based on the [Lox][https://lox](http://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) programming language, from the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. Cube also has some roots on the [Caboose](https://docs.caboose.ga/) programming language.
